						<p><b>Sickle Cell Society</b> was chosen by O.<br>
						The Sickle Cell Society is the only national charity in the UK that supports and represents people
						affected by a sickle cell disorder to improve their overall quality of life.<br>
						First set up as a registered charity in 1979, the Sickle Cell Society has been working alongside health care professionals,
						parents, and people living with sickle cell to raise awareness of the disorder. The Society's aim is to support those living
						with sickle cell, empowering them to achieve their full potential.<br>
						The Sickle Cell Society believes that individuals with sickle cell have the right to quality care. This can only be achieved
						if funding is made available to educate health carers and other professionals about the condition. The Society aims to provide this.<br>
						They have a network of committed volunteers, who play an important part in running the charity, providing administrative backup, and
						helping with fund-raising activities.</p>

							<b>Cancer Is A Drag</b> was chosen by Jon.<br>
							Cancer is a Drag's aim is to help as many people living with cancer as possible,
							inclusive of partners, family and friends, to overcome the difficulties they face on a day-to-day basis – by providing
							financial support where it is most needed, freeing up our beneficiaries and their families to deal with the disease
							and its treatments – to stop cancer being any more of a drag than it already is.
