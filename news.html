						<br>Busy Busy Busy.
						<br>We've been really busy working on the lighting and decor this last week, the old Peek backdrops have surfaced!
						<br>Promo mix incoming.
						<br>As you glance up to the decks you see a flash of blue and standing there is Captain America, or well it looked like him, but 50 years on.  The music however isn't aged, it's banging Tech-House making you skip and reach for the ceiling gurning like a chimp in a banana field.
						<br>There is a Tech-House promo mix up on the <a href="https://peekender.uk/mixes.html">mixes page</a>

						<br>The wonderful people from Wonkey Donkey Bar will be joining us for the weekend

					<p>21 June 2024
						<br>Promo Mix incoming.
						<br>From deep within the Cybersphere, a flash of psychedelic colour and a deep laugh emiited, followed by a great rush of smoke and suddenly, and there on the couch sits a tall hooded figure, the sound of gamma goblins subsides and the Freaky Bob asks "Where's the party?".
						<br>Freaky Bob covers the whole of the psy genre for Peek, pulling us deep into the colourful psychedelic world of Psy Trance, whirling us round at enormous speeds then dropping us in a frenzied mess at his feet.
						<br>Having spun his magic for Peek, Freaky Bob has spread his psychedelic tendrils for Elemental, Atomic Energy, Ambivalent Records and Tribe of Frog and countless free parties and even played for the devil running his own Mobile Disco company for several years.
						<br>There is a Psy Trance promo mix up on the <a href="https://peekender.uk/mixes.html">mixes page</a>

						<br>Tickets.
						<br>Tickets are selling fast now, if you have your tickets already let everyone know you're going and give them the webpage link.
						<br>If you haven't bought tickets get on the case and secure the weekend for you and your friends.
						<br>The more tickets we sell upfront the more we can organise.
						<br>The tickets are here on the <a href="https://peekender.uk/tickets.html">tickets page</a>
						<br>Don't forget we have a split payment option, and we will be releasing the day tickets a little bit earlier as a few have asked for them.

					<p>13 June 2024
						<br>Promo Mix incoming.
						<br>Following on from Jonny's mix we have a mix up from Andy AT*iT. Inspired from the start by Perry and Bradley ripping up the cheesy chip refectory at DeMontfort Uni he took a trip down to London and bought some CDJ's and a mixer with a briefcase of fivers, and was immediately laughed at, but now everyone uses CD's innit, so he's moved to digital.
						<br>Clearly not fit to play with Peek he started The Usual Suspects with Freaky Bob, Prav and Little Andy, putting on a few messy nights before moving to Brighton, buying a knackered old rig and putting on free parties under the name of System AT*iT in and around Brighton, moving on to club nights as Bl1nk and then moving to Melbourne and playing with Virus Sound System.
						<br>Andy has been banging out annoying Techno usually off his chops for years.
						<br>There is a Techno/Trance promo mix up on the <a href="https://peekender.uk/mixes.html">mixes page</a>

					<p>26 May 2024
						<br>Promo Mix incoming.
						<br>Needing no introduction to Peek Crew, one of the founding duo of Peek, Jon Bradley has been DJing since before records were even invented, often just beat matching two violins with his good friend Mozart, but only making his debut at a babble rabble gig in the Mud Club, when it was just made of mud
						<br>Recently Jon has been making his own music again under the name of Jay Gecko, in case of any copyright issues, and playing abroad yearly at the Love International festival.
						<br>Jon is our master mixing effortlessly between, trance, acid and techno, the three pillars of Peek.
